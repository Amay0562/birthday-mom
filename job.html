	<h1>Her job:</h1>
	<h2> My mom is a teacher, she loves to teach!</h2>
	<p>Currently she is a teacher at <strong>JKBS</strong> Buisness school as an AI or IT teacher, thats the  subject she teaches.
	when I was really young she used to work at <strong>IBMR</strong> she used to love it and her collegues loved her as well.
	<strong>IBMR</strong> sounded like a really fun place to teach and it was settled for her because she used to send me and my brother to a daycare which was convieniently the same school I used to study in, I remember I used to <strong> love</strong> that place! The only thing I hated was when I had to sleep for 2 hours daily while everyone was having fun because my mom told the daycare staff to make me sleep for wo hours everyday.</p>
	<p>For some reason she thought me and my brother were not safe enough so, she <strong> quit her job</strong>!!! After over 2 years of service there.</p>
