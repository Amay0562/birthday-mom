	<p class = "fantasy">One very recent example of this is that about a month ago I turned 10 one week after that, registration of a very popular football tornament started I thought that although I'm 10 years old I can play for under 10
	<img class = "left" src = "fortuneteller.png" align = "left" >
    group because I only turned 10 a week ago, but I was wrong, and my mom forcasted that this would happen so I started crying because the next age group I would play in I thought that I woudn't know anybody but, my mom 
	said to play. At the last day of registration I got to know that more than half of the people in the under 14 group were people I knew, by the time I told my mom it was too late. ): so my mom was right.</p>

	<h2> So you see, she is some kind of fortune teller.</h2>

	<p>When the food looks bad and it feels like I won't like it at all my mom tells me to eat it and try and it tastes <strong><i>so good!</i></strong></p>
